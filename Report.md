# Supervised Machine Learning-Reflection and Reporting

**Hypothesis for both models:**    I think the Random Forest Classifier will be a more effective model because the data that we were provided is a large set with a high amount of dimensionality. Linear Regression is more effective with data that has less attributes.

**Unscaled model conclusion:** The Random Forest Classifier performed better which aligned with my hypothesis. The Linear Regression model had a score that was way less than that of the Random Forest Classifier. Because of the amount of dimensions of the data that were provided, the Random Forest Classifier is a more fitting model to evaluate the data.

**Scaled model prediction:** Scaling is used used for Linear Regression to bring residual error down and create a more accurate model to analyze, therefore, the scaled data will bring up the accuracy of the Linear Regression model. Random Forest Classifier will not be impacted much because it is not dependent on residual error.

**Scaled model conclusion:** The Linear Regression Model's accuracy went up and the Random Forest Classifier's accuracy did not change much. I believe that this result aligned with my hypothesis based on the effect of residual error on both models.
